class_name RotatableInteraction
extends AbstractInteraction

"""
RotatableInteraction is an intermediary interaction class that defines rotation 
related properties and setup.  

This class does not implement the full rotation behavior itself; child classes 
should handle the actual rotation logic and interaction mechanics.  Use this as 
a base for doors, wheels, switches, or any other rotatable objects in the game.
