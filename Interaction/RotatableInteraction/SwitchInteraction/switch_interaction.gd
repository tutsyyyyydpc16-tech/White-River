class_name SwitchInteraction
extends RotatableInteraction

"""
SwitchInteraction handles all player interactions with lever-style switches.

Features:
- Detects player input to rotate the switch.
- Applies smooth snapping to either the starting or maximum rotation when the
  player releases the switch.
- Plays movement sounds while the switch is being dragged, with dynamic volume
  scaling based on angular velocity.
- Plays a snapping/impact sound once when the switch reaches its final
  position.

Use this class for interactive levers or any switch object that
rotates within a limited range.
