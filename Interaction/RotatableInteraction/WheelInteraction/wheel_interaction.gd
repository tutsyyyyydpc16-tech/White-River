class_name WheelInteraction
extends RotatableInteraction

"""
WheelInteraction handles the rotation and interaction logic for a rotatable wheel object in the game. 

Features include:
- Player-driven rotation using mouse input for smooth movement.
- Optional fixed kickback when the player releases the wheel, simulating a ratchet and pawl system.
- Audio feedback for both rotation and kickback events.

Use this class for interactive wheels or valves.
