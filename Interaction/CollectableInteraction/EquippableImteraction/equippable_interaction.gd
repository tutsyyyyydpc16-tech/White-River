class_name EquippableInteraction
extends CollectableInteraction

"""
ConsumableInteraction handles objects that the player can pick up in the world.  
It extends AbstractInteraction to reuse common interaction logic while adding 
pickup-specific behavior like sound effects when the item is picked up, emitting 
an `item_collected` signal to notify inventory systems, preventing further interaction 
while the item is being collected, and removing the item from the scene once the 
collection is complete

This class is suitable for any item the player can grab and add to their inventory 
or trigger collection events.
